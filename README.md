# Align-Yoga-Studio
A home page for a fictional yoga studio.
With every project I create, I learn so much and I am honored. 
This project allowed me to flex my skills and knowledge of flex box and CSS animation which is so fun. 
This project also made me confident about making headers and understanding how to use flex containers to my advantage. 
I encourage anyone who wants to learn flx box and CSS animation to use this project to practice.
